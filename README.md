Hi! 

I’m @IvaRadoeva, a Bachlor's student at the University of Amsterdam specialising in Brain & Cognition with a marked interest in programming and mathematics. I created this profile to track my projects' progress and further develop my skills in R and Python. During high-school I gained experience in C++, Java, and SQL, so the occasional throwback is possible. If my project seem interesting to you, feel free to reach out, I would love to collaborate!

Happy coding :)
